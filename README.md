This repository demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability in a React-Node.js application.

## Setup

### Server-side Installation

1. cd into the `server` directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

### Client-side Installation

1. cd into the `client` directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## Vulnerability

The vulnerability is in the `server/routes/users.js` file. The `login` route is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `login` route is defined as follows:

```
router.post('/login', function(req, res, next) {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const password = req.body.password;

  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
```

### üöÄ Usage

1. Visit the application in your browser and enter the following SQL query:
```' or 1=1 --```

2. Enter the following SQL query:
``` ' or True -- ```

This will display all values as the condition is true, bypassing the password requirement.
